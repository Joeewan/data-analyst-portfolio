# Fruit Sales Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a simulated fruit sales dataset. It explores revenue trends, sales performance by fruit and region, seasonal patterns, and actionable insights.

## Dataset
- 500 transactions
- Columns include: Fruit, Region, Date, Season, Units Sold, Unit Price, Revenue

## Analysis Questions
1. What are the overall sales and revenue patterns in the dataset?
2. Which regions generate the most revenue?
3. How does fruit sales revenue change over time throughout the year?
4. Which fruits contribute the most to total revenue and units sold?
5. Is there a relationship between unit price and units sold?
7. What actionable recommendations can improve sales across regions and seasons?

## Key Findings
- Monthly revenue shows seasonal trends, peaking during summer months.
- North and Tropical regions generate the highest revenue overall.
- Top-selling fruits include Mango, Apple, and Banana, contributing disproportionately to total revenue.
- Higher-priced fruits tend to sell fewer units but generate higher revenue per item.
- A small number of fruits dominate revenue, suggesting targeted marketing and inventory strategies.
