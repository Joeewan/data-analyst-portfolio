This project demonstrates a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a simulated fruit sales dataset of 500 transactions across multiple regions and seasons.
The analysis focuses on understanding overall sales patterns, revenue trends over time, top-performing products, and regional performance. 
Key insights include monthly revenue trends, identification of fruits driving the highest revenue and units sold, and the impact of pricing and seasonality on sales. 
Visualizations such as bar charts and line graphs were used to clearly communicate findings. This project showcases skills in data cleaning, 
aggregation, visualization, trend analysis, and business interpretation, providing actionable insights that could guide inventory management, marketing focus, and sales strategies in a real-world business context.

To understand sales performance over time, revenue was analyzed across the calendar year. By grouping daily sales data by month, we can identify overall trends and potential seasonality patterns that may impact fruit sales.
