# Credit Risk Analysis & Loan Default Prediction

**Predictive Modeling | Financial Risk Analytics | Machine Learning Classification**

---

## 1. Project Overview

This project applies data analytics and machine learning to evaluate borrower risk and predict loan default probability. The objective is to support data-driven underwriting decisions by identifying high-risk applicants before loan approval.

Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and supervised classification models, this project demonstrates how predictive analytics can reduce financial exposure and improve credit risk management strategies.

## 2. Business Problem

Financial institutions must balance revenue growth with risk mitigation. Poor credit risk assessment can lead to increased default rates and financial losses.

This project addresses the following business challenges:

* Identify key financial indicators associated with loan default
* Quantify borrower risk using predictive modeling
* Improve risk segmentation and underwriting decisions
* Minimize expected loan losses through data-driven strategies

The goal is to leverage statistical analysis and machine learning to enhance credit approval frameworks.

## 3. Dataset Description

A structured dataset of 2,000 simulated borrowers was generated to model realistic lending behavior. The dataset includes demographic, financial, and credit-related variables commonly used in credit risk analysis.

### Key Variables:

* Credit Score
* Annual Income
* Employment Length
* Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)
* Loan Amount
* Interest Rate
* Loan Term
* Previous Defaults
* Loan Purpose
* Default (Binary Target Variable)

The dataset was engineered to reflect realistic risk patterns where lower credit scores, higher DTI, and prior defaults increase default probability.

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Comprehensive exploratory data analysis was conducted to identify patterns, correlations, and risk drivers.

### Analytical Techniques:

* Distribution analysis of financial metrics
* Default rate segmentation
* Correlation matrix and multicollinearity assessment
* Boxplot comparison of risk factors by default status
* Risk threshold analysis (DTI and credit score bands)

### Key Insights:

* Borrowers with high debt-to-income ratios exhibited significantly higher default rates.
* Lower credit scores strongly correlated with default probability.
* Previous default history substantially increased financial risk.
* Loan-to-income ratio emerged as a critical financial stress indicator.

These findings informed feature selection and predictive modeling strategy.

## 5. Feature Engineering

To improve model performance and predictive accuracy, advanced feature engineering techniques were applied:

* Creation of Loan-to-Income Ratio metric
* One-hot encoding of categorical variables
* Feature scaling using StandardScaler
* Target variable encoding for binary classification

These transformations enhanced model interpretability and classification performance.

## 6. Machine Learning Modeling & Evaluation

Supervised learning algorithms were implemented to predict loan default:

### Logistic Regression

* Baseline classification model
* Interpretable coefficients for financial risk analysis
* Suitable for probability-based risk scoring

### Random Forest Classifier

* Captures non-linear relationships
* Provides feature importance analysis
* Improved predictive performance and robustness

### Model Evaluation Metrics:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall (prioritized to identify high-risk borrowers)
* ROC-AUC Score
* Confusion Matrix

Emphasis was placed on recall and ROC-AUC, as financial institutions prioritize minimizing false negatives (undetected high-risk borrowers).

## 7. Results & Business Impact

### Model Findings:

* Credit score and debt-to-income ratio were the most significant predictors of default.
* Previous defaults dramatically increased predicted risk probability.
* Financial burden indicators (DTI and loan-to-income ratio) were critical in risk segmentation.

### Business Recommendations:

* Implement risk-based pricing strategies using predicted default probability.
* Establish enhanced underwriting review for applicants with DTI > 40%.
* Incorporate predictive scoring into loan approval workflows.
* Use classification models to reduce expected credit losses and improve portfolio quality.

This project demonstrates the practical application of data science, predictive analytics, and financial risk modeling to support strategic business decision-making.
